These files implement the instructions in the 
[getting started guide](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/user-guides/addressbase-products-getting-started-guide.pdf) in SQL rather than having to follow through the instructions on pgAdmin.

You will need to update references to your database and the place on your disk where you're storing the .csvs

Use at your own risk - I welcome any corrections.
